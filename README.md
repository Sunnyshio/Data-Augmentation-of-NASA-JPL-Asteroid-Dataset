# Data-Augmentation-of-NASA-JPL-Asteroid-Dataset

This project focuses on applying data augmentation techniques on NASA's asteroid dataset. Asteroid datasets, especially those capturing rare or unique features, often face challenges like null values and imbalanced classes. These issues can hinder analysis and reduce the performance of models trained on the data. In this project, I aim to produce a dataset that is ready for exploration and processing.
